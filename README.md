5-day weather forecast sample app

## Synopsis

This is a quick and dirty 5-day weather forecast responsive app.  A user enters a city, and the app uses OpenWeatherMap Api to retreive the 5-day forecast.

## Motivation

A step in the interview process at BuildIt 

## Installation

Download the repository and just open the index.html file in a browser

## Tests

Input any city name to retrieve the 5-day weather forecast

## Thought Process
Due to limited time constraint, this is a quick and dirty app to demonstrate the desired functionality.  

## Trade Offs
The application folder structure could be better optimized.  The functions written could be optimized and cleanly documented.
